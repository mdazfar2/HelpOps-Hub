# NGINX Reverse Proxy Guide üõ°Ô∏è

Welcome to the NGINX Reverse Proxy Guide! In this guide, we'll walk you through setting up NGINX as a reverse proxy server to bolster your infrastructure's security and performance.

## Introduction

A reverse proxy server acts as a shield between clients and backend servers, boosting security, load balancing, and caching capabilities. NGINX stands out as a versatile tool for configuring reverse proxy servers efficiently.

## Prerequisites

Ensure you have the following installed on your system:
- A Linux-based operating system
- Basic understanding of Linux system administration

## Installation Steps

### 1. Install NGINX

Use your package manager to install NGINX on your system.

```
sudo apt update
sudo apt install nginx
```

### 2. Start NGINX and Configure to Launch on Reboot
Start the NGINX service with the systemctl command:

```
sudo systemctl start nginx
```

To configure NGINX to launch on reboot automatically, enable the service with:

```
sudo systemctl enable nginx
```

To check if the NGINX server is running, use:

```
sudo systemctl status nginx
```

### 2. Create a Configuration File

Create a new configuration file for your reverse proxy settings. You can create a file named `reverse_proxy.conf` in the NGINX configuration directory (often located at `/etc/nginx/conf.d/` or `/etc/nginx/sites-available/`).

```
sudo nano /etc/nginx/conf.d/reverse_proxy.conf
```

### 3. Configure Reverse Proxy

Add the following configuration to your `reverse_proxy.conf` file:

```
server {
    listen 80;
    server_name example.com;

    location / {
        proxy_pass http://backend_server;
        proxy_set_header Host $host;
        proxy_set_header X-Real-IP $remote_addr;
        proxy_set_header X-Forwarded-For $proxy_add_x_forwarded_for;
        proxy_set_header X-Forwarded-Proto $scheme;
    }
}
```
Replace `example.com` with your domain name and `backend_server` with the IP address or domain name of your backend server.

### 4. Test Configuration

Check the NGINX configuration for syntax errors:

```
sudo nginx -t
```

If there are no errors, reload NGINX to apply the new configuration:

```
sudo systemctl reload nginx
```

## Conclusion üéâ

By setting up NGINX as a reverse proxy, you can improve security, scalability, and performance in your environment. Experiment with different NGINX features and configurations to optimize your reverse proxy setup according to your specific requirements.

Happy proxying with NGINX! üöÄüîí
